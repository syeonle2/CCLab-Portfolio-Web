    <h2>Critical Computation Lab Assignment 07 | Autobiographical Game</h2>
    <h5>This is my project for 'Autobiographical Game' assignment.</h5>
    <br>
    <h9>Project Description</h9>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>This project was about making a game that can represent myself.</p1><br>
    <p1>I made a face full of bubbles that changes colors of bubbles and can interact with moving your mouse.</p1> <br>
    <p1>'Unusual Patissier' is a game about a bunny who wants to join her friend's party but can't afford to buy her a present.</p1> <br>
    <p1> They have been friends since they were babies, so they know each other really well and love each other a lot.</p1> <br>
    <p1> Their friendship is still ongoing, but it has been so long since they've met each other because of their schoolwork and other things.</p1> <br>
    <p1> Their lives have been so busy, as we all do when we grow up.</p1><br>
     <br>
    <p1> This game is about what the true friendship is.</p1> <br>
    <p1> Even though the bunny didn't buy the friend a gift, the friend still feels happy because she could see her love in the cake by seeing lots of carrots in the cake, which is her favorite vegetable.</p1><br> 
     <p1> When we feel other people's love, it's not about the money they spend for you, the important thing is how much they care about you.</p1> <br>
     <p1> This is what I feel about friendship and what I always feel about other's gifts.</p1> <br>
     <br>
    <p1>Below is the game 'Unusual Patissier'. Hope you'll enjoy it!</p1>
